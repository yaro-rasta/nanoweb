      <p>On the occasion of International Museum Day in 2022, the pan-European federation of cultural associations "Europa Nostra" and the Global Heritage Fund, in partnership with the International Alliance for the Protection of Heritage in Conflict Areas (ALIPH Foundation) and the Heritage Rescue Headquarters, established the <b>Heritage Solidarity Fellowship for Ukraine</b>.</p>
      <p><b>Objective</b> – to provide support to cultural professionals in Ukraine during difficult times.</p>
      <p>The amount of the one-time scholarship is 500 euros, equivalent to Ukrainian hryvnia. Applications for the scholarship could be submitted personally or by recommending another individual, sharing their story and justifying their eligibility for the scholarship.</p>
