                *
              # [ nwDataUri ] | '*' | 0
              write:
                uk/goods/
                uk/goods.yaml

              delete:
                uk/goods/
              # [ nwDataUri ] | '*' | 0
              # trust is required to write or delete data without approval by admin
              trust: 0
            - group access:
              # same as user access
              
        - each page (nwDataUri) has:
          - an edit button that allows chaning all the data in that file + add new attributes and content
          - see the parent options to the root
